### Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at Catholic University of Brasilia, iOS developer at [Developer Academy/UCB](https://developeracademyucb.com.br/), and iOS developer at [Dimensa](https://dimensa.com/).

I work with the UIKit, SwiftUI, SpriteKit, CoreData and RxSwift frameworks. 
I often use SnapKit and Alamofire for most of my projects. 
I build screens using view code and am a fan of protocol oriented programming. 
 Currently I am dedicated to studying XCTest and Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.
